        "\n",
        "- **Simplicity and Readability**: Python's easy-to-understand syntax allows programmers to focus on solving problems rather than navigating complex code structures.\n",
        "- **Interpreted Language**: Python executes code line-by-line, simplifying debugging and improving productivity.\n",
        "- **Dynamically Typed**: Python automatically determines variable types at runtime, removing the need for manual type declarations.\n",
        "- **Extensive Libraries**: Python has powerful libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **TensorFlow**, which support applications ranging from data analysis and artificial intelligence to web development.\n",
        "- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python code runs smoothly across different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
