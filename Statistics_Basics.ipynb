        "       - **Ordinal**: Categories with a meaningful order but no fixed interval (e.g., survey satisfaction levels: good, average, poor).  \n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Quantitative Data**: Numerical data representing quantities.  \n",
        "     - Examples: Age, height, income.  \n",
        "     - Scales:  \n",
        "       - **Interval**: Numerical data with no true zero, equal intervals (e.g., temperature in Celsius).  \n",
        "       - **Ratio**: Numerical data with a true zero, equal intervals (e.g., weight, income).  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each?**  \n",
        "   - **Mean**: The average of all data points. Use when data is symmetric and has no extreme outliers.  \n",
        "     - Example: Average test scores.  \n",
        "   - **Median**: The middle value when data is ordered. Use when data is skewed or has outliers.  \n",
        "     - Example: Median income in a region.  \n",
        "   - **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value. Use for categorical data or finding the most common value.  \n",

        "   - **Dispersion**: Refers to how spread out data points are around the central value.  \n",
        "   - **Variance**: The average squared difference from the mean, indicating variability.  \n",
        "   - **Standard Deviation**: The square root of variance, showing average deviation in the same units as the data.  \n",
        "     - Example: A lower standard deviation means data points are closer to the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "   - **Types**:  \n",
        "     - **Positive Skew**: Tail on the right; mean > median.  \n",
        "     - **Negative Skew**: Tail on the left; mean < median.  \n",
        "   - **Effect**: Skewness impacts the choice of measures like mean (sensitive to skewness) vs. median (resistant).\n",
