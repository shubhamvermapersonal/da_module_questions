        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is often done through access modifiers (e.g., private, protected).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: This is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts of it. In OOP, this can be achieved by creating abstract classes or interfaces that provide a blueprint for subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. It promotes code reusability and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods that share the same name, but each class can implement them in different ways. This makes the system more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Association**: This refers to the relationship between different classes, indicating how one class can be related to another. There are different types of association, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Write a Python class for a `Car` with attributes for `make`, `model`, and `year`. Include a method to display the car's information.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "        self.year = year\n",
        "\n",
        "    def display_info(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Car Info: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",

        "This class defines a `Car` with three attributes: `make`, `model`, and `year`. The `display_info` method prints out the car's details.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Explain the difference between instance methods and class methods. Provide an example of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Instance Methods**: These are methods that are bound to an instance of the class. They have access to both instance attributes and other instance methods. The first argument to an instance method is always `self`, which refers to the current instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class MyClass:\n",
        "      def instance_method(self):\n",
        "          print(\"This is an instance method.\")\n",

        "  obj = MyClass()\n",
        "  obj.instance_method()  # Calls the instance method\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Class Methods**: These methods are bound to the class rather than the instance. They take the class itself as their first argument (`cls`) and are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator. Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes but not instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  class MyClass:\n",
        "      @classmethod\n",
        "      def class_method(cls):\n",
        "          print(\"This is a class method.\")\n",
        "  \n",
        "  MyClass.class_method()  # Calls the class method\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters. Instead, Python achieves method overloading by using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "calc = Calculator()\n",
        "print(calc.add(5))        # Output: 5\n",
        "print(calc.add(5, 3))     # Output: 8\n",
        "print(calc.add(5, 3, 2))  # Output: 10\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, the `add` method uses default values to achieve overloading behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What are the three types of access modifiers in Python? How are they denoted?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Public**: Public members of a class can be accessed from anywhere. They are denoted without any underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example: `variable_name`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Protected**: Protected members are intended for internal use and should not be accessed directly outside the class. They are denoted by a single underscore (`_`).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example: `_variable_name`\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Private**: Private members are not accessible directly from outside the class and are used to prevent external modification. They are denoted by double underscores (`__`).\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example: `__variable_name`\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Describe the five types of inheritance in Python. Provide a simple example of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from a single parent class.\n",
        "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from another class, which in turn inherits from another class.\n",
        "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
        "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of different types of inheritance (e.g., multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of **Multiple Inheritance**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",

        "### 7. What is the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python? How can you retrieve it programmatically?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Method Resolution Order (MRO) defines the order in which Python looks for methods and attributes in classes, especially in the case of multiple inheritance. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "To retrieve the MRO programmatically:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    pass\n",

        "class B(A):\n",

        "    pass\n",
        "\n",
        "print(D.mro())\n",
        "```\n",
        "This will return the MRO for class `D`, showing the order in which Python will search for methods.\n",

        "### 8. Create an abstract base class `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`. Then create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that implement the `area()` method.\n",
